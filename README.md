# learning-bio

I'm trying to learn computational biology and bioinformatics by myself.
This repository is for implementing algorithms, taking notes, and generally showing my work.
My approach is to use materials from several OCW courses and books, and try to implement assignments and make writeups. 
Courses that I have in mind rn are:
- [Computational biology 6-047 2005](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-047-computational-biology-fall-2015/)
- [Algorithms for computational biology 6-096 2006](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-096-algorithms-for-computational-biology-spring-2005/)
- [Foundations of computational and systems biology 7-91j 2014](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-91j-foundations-of-computational-and-systems-biology-spring-2014/)
- [Introduction to computational molecular biology 18-417 2004](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-417-introduction-to-computational-molecular-biology-fall-2004/)

As supplements to my learning i use these books:
1. An introduction to bioinformatics algorithms
2. First course in systems biology
3. essential cell biology          
4. BioBuilder O'reilly            
6. Synthetic biology: a primer
7. Concepts of genetics

### Please do keep in mind that this is a work-in-progress, part-time project.
and by no means am i even remotely close to being knowlegable about and of these topics. Implementations will sometimes be 'bare-bones' and minimalistic, as their role is not 'make industry-grade tool' but 'understand the core concepts in this method'
